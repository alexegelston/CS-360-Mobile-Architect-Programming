# CS-360-Mobile-Architect-Programming
A repository for my CS-360 course project.



    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    The reuirements and goals of the application that I developed was a secure user login, tracking user entered events to track in a CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) format, and an SMS messaging system for alerting to upcoming events.
    
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    An intial login screen was necessary to ensure that the user is able to access their individual database entries. There was also a main screen required for a calendar view to display the events to the user. The user interface was designed to be as simple as possible for efficiency. 
    
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    I had to follow several video tutorials that helped me to learn how to implement different methods.
    
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    I tested the application to ensure the code was functional by running it in a virtual machine on Android Studio. This process was extremely important because it revealed everytime there was an error in the development process that caused the application to not work.
    
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    There was definitely a lot of innovating, or at least troubleshooting, when it came to classes related to the CRUD functionality. 
    
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    I feel that the layout and constraints relating to objects in each screen came out very well for the mobile application.
